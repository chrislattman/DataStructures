# DataStructures

Collection of implemented data structures and algorithms in Java, some C++, and Python, as well as multithreading examples in Java.

- For the Java examples, these are not exact copies of the Java Collections Framework, since there is no such thing as an ArrayQueue (rather, there is the ArrayDeque) and LinkedList is slightly different (doubly-linked, for one), both of which implement the Deque interface
- There are also no NavigableMap/NavigableSet, SortedMap/SortedSet, or SequencedMap/SequencedSet interfaces

The multithreading examples were taken from [`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9s_d28yJq0&list=PLfqABt5AS4FmuQf70psXrsMLEDQXNkLq2`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9s_d28yJq0&list=PLfqABt5AS4FmuQf70psXrsMLEDQXNkLq2)

Note: before building documentation or generating code coverage for the Python code, run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Likewise for Java, run

```
./installj.sh
```
